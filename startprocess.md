*Raymond Lin - Fall 2024*
*Ubuntu, i.e. Linux/WSL, User*
*My Getting Started Process*

As instructed by the lead Sam, I will be using this file to document anything I've learned or done for the project over the span of the semester. I'll be explaining my learning process and will include anything I plan to do for the rest of the year.

Sam instructed us to follow the instructions in the startup.md file in the Heather branch of the main project. 

The document began with recommending me to use Linux or WSL. I have used Ubuntu before because of a previous RCOS project I've done. Ubuntu is Linux/WSL, so I'll use that to work on this project. The document also stated I should read the onboarding.md before continuing on.
